<h1>GSM Cloning</h1>

<p><b>History:</b>
On April 13, 1998, the <a href="http://www.scard.org">Smartcard
Developer Association</a> and the
<a href="http://www.isaac.cs.berkeley.edu">ISAAC security research group</a>
announced a flaw in the authentication
codes found in digital GSM cellphones.  This allows an attacker with
physical access to a target phone to make an exact duplicate (a ``clone'')
and to make fraudulent calls billed to the target user's account.</p>

<p>At the time of the announcement, we published an
<a href="gsm-faq.html">overview of our results</a>,
including some detailed technical information.
(Note that some of this information, specifically regarding the
possibility of over-the-air cloning, is now outdated.
See below for more discussion.)</p>

<p>Readers of the <tt>scard</tt> mailing list have pointed out that,
in Europe, one can anonymously rent GSM cellphones quite cheaply.
The prospect of those phones getting cloned is a bit worrisome.</p>

<p><b>Three years later:</b>
Indications are that the GSM industry is taking steps to
repair the security weaknesses in the GSM cryptographic algorithms.
A patched version of COMP128 is now available (called COMP128-2),
although it remains unpublished.

<p>Most importantly, the GSM industry appears to have
at least partially learned the important lesson here:
`security through obscurity doesn't work'.
The next-generation replacement for GSM, called 3GPP,
will use algorithms developed based on principles from the
research literature.
The 3GPP cryptographic algorithms have been published for
scientists to study, which gives the research community a chance
to give early warning of any potential weaknesses and also to gain
confidence in the 3GPP ciphers.
I am strongly supportive of this effort.

<p>Note that the other major players in this arena moved some time ago
to open design processes.  This includes the next-generation AES
standard process being shepherded by the US government, as well as
the US cellular industry.  The US cellular industry is an interesting
case study: initially they used closed design, but after several of
their cryptographic algorithms were rapidly broken by cryptographers
in the open research community, to their credit
they quickly moved to an open design process.  I am glad that the
GSM/3GPP industry has recognized the benefits of this approach.</p>

<p>I also understand that the GSM Association has agreed to develop a new,
stronger voice encryption cipher called A5/3, apparently based on Kasumi
(a block cipher which was developed based on principles from the
research literature).  It will apparently become mandatory to support
A5/3 at some point in the future.
I strongly support the GSM Association's efforts to repair the
ailing series of voice privacy algorithms and provide robust voice privacy
protection for the future.

<p><b>Over-the-air cloning:</b>
In our original announcement, we noted that we could not rule out
the possibility of over-the-air attacks, but we emphasized that we had not
demonstrated such an attack.
At that time, we did not provide any further analysis on the
resources required to mount an over-the-air attack.
There was, for obvious reasons, considerable interest in the possibility
of over-the-air attacks, and we had reason to suspect they might be
possible, but we wanted to be extremely conservative in reporting only
what we knew for certain was exploitable.
That viewpoint is probably now best regarded as outdated.</p>

<p> Since then,
extensive conversations with many knowledgeable GSM engineers
has caused us to conclude that over-the-air attacks must be considered
available to the sophisticated attacker in practice.
We still have not attempted to build a laboratory demonstration
(it would apparently be illegal to do this type of research under US law),
but the GSM experts we've spoken with have confirmed that it should
be possible and practical to do so.
They have reported that
a number of aspects of the GSM protocols combine to make it possible to
mount the mathematical chosen-input attack on COMP128, if one can build
a fake base station.
Such a fake base station does not need to support the full GSM protocol,
and it may be possible to build one with an investment
of approximately $10k.</p>

<p>Some technical expertise is probably required to pull off the
over-the-air cloning attack, and the attack requires over-the-air
access to the target handset for a relatively long period of time.
Therefore, this may be considered a lower level of risk than
that found in old US analog systems with no authentication at all.
Nonetheless, please note that it would be a mistake to underestimate
the technical sophistication or the financial resources of some of
today's attackers: some of them are surprisingly well-positioned
to mount even relatively sophisticated and costly attacks.
Therefore, we feel that the new information
provides evidence that <em>over-the-air cloning must be considered a very
real threat</em> which should not be ignored.</p>

For the mathematicians and cryptographers: It seems that the COMP128
algorithm has leaked abroad to
<a href="http://www.scard.org/gsm/a3a8.txt">this web site</a>
(see also, e.g., <a href="http://www.iol.ie/~kooltek/a3a8.txt">here</a>).
(I was emailed this information just a day after the announcement of
our results.  It wasn't me; I didn't leak or export
the information.)
And the <a href="http://jya.com/gsm061088.htm">leaked GSM document specifying
COMP128</a> is also available on the net, thanks to
